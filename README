GPS::Magellan version 0.5
=========================

The feature list is rather short:

  * Downloads waypoint and tracklog data from Magellan 
    receivers via serial port

  * Dump coordinates on stdout or into a file.  At this moment the 
    GpsDrive way.txt file format is implemented, and there is a 
    flexible framework so adding new formats/parsers shouldn't be 
    too hard.


STORY

    This module first came into existence as a set of hacks against 
    Brian J. Hennings' gpsutil[1] program, which was working with my
    Magellan receiver (thanks for that, Brian).  But I wanted a 
    Perl interface and GPS::Garmin (although Magellan support is 
    mentioned in the docs) it couldn't talk to my Magellan.

    In the first iteration the C code was just passing back output
    to Perl, which then re-parsed it (I needed to convert the data convert 
    into different file formats)... 

    Eventually, I rewrote some of Brian's code (the higher level 
    protocol and message-parsing routines) as a Perl module, which 
    then I glued to some parts of his code using perl XS.  Essentially, 
    the C code takes care of the serial port and NMEA checksums.  
    Perl routines do their job on clean CSV data.


STATUS

    This project is far from being mature, it's ALPHA code (although it 
    *does* contain a quite extensive test suite that covers most of 
    the functionality).  

    Originally, I was looking for a similar project in a more matured state 
    but couldn't find one.  But I'd still be up for it, so please mail me
    if you work on such code!  

    I'm also looking into the possibilities of sharing code or joining 
    other module trees (beneath GPS:: for instance, but anywhere it 
    makes sense).  Having a common interface with other device-specific
    GPS communication modules (GPS::Garmin the only one I know of,
    there may be others...) would also be a nice thing.


PLANNED FEATURES

    There are going to be implemented Real Soon Now as I want to draw maps
    during my trip to the US in June!

  * A command line tool (look in the examples/ directory for an 
    almost finished one, it takes care of the core business with 
    a little obvious tweaking involved ;-) (TRACKLOG/WAYPOINT)

  * Uploading waypoints to the receiver

  * Even write documentation!

BUGS

    Send bugs to <peter@login-fo.net>.

DEPENDENCIES

    A few modules that should be among the standard Perl libs.

DISCLAIMER

    All standard disclaimers apply; this code is provided "AS IS".
    If it erases your three years' worth of tracklog database, all you 
    can do is sit back, open a beer and relax.  Please let me know, 
    however, about serious bugs like sleeping with your wife or stealing
    your bike.
